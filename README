DESCRIPTION:

    What is TinyMVC?
    
    TinyMVC is an Model-View-Controller application framework for PHP.
    Its design goals are to minimally provide separation between the database
    operations (Model), the presentation (View), and the glue in between
    (Controller). With very little extras bundled in, this framework is
    extremely fast and flexible. Some design aspects and terminology of TinyMVC
    have been inspired by other PHP frameworks, although the code is 100%
    original.

    What TinyMVC is NOT
    
    TinyMVC is NOT a full-featured framework. As it stands, it is a simple
    MVC structure with a database support layer (PDO). Any and all features
    you desire (form validation, session handling, etc.) are easily added
    with your own plugins. Plugins will become available in the wiki as
    they are programmed or contributed by other users. If a plugin is
    essential enough, it may eventually find its way to the core distribution.


REQUIREMENTS:    
    
    TinyMVC requires PHP 5. The bundled database library requires PDO,
    which is included with PHP 5.1 and up.
   
   
FEATURES:

    TinyMVC supplies easy separation between Model, View and
    Controller, and supports PDO for the database abstraction layer. Each
    and every component of TinyMVC is customizable with class extensions,
    and the framework is easily extended with your own plugins.
    
    Multiple applications are also easy to handle. You can drop your plugins
    in at the application level, or you can share them across applications.
    The file structure is setup so your customizations are kept isolated from
    the core, so updates are easy to maintain.
