myfiles/plugins

Place plugins here.

In a single-application install (one "myapp" directory), it is OK
to put all plugins in myapp/plugins and leave myfiles/plugins alone.

In a multi-application install, shared plugins should be placed in
myfiles/plugins, and application-specific plugins go in myapp/plugins.

You should never touch files under the sysfiles directory.
